The http link given in the DESCRIPTION field does not yet exist.  I am timing the release of this package to coincide with the announcement a new host site (pointed to by the http link) for the 'Maxent' Java package.  The new website is still under construction.  A temporary version is at http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent_preview/.  

The current release adds a bit more documentation on feature types, as required by a reviewer of the accompanying paper.
